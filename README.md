# Formula E Team Interactive Circuit Map using Mapbox

# Deployment Instructions

* **Note**: This is the deployment instructions to deliver clear understanding.

# Problem Statement

* **Circuit Map:** In the Formula E website, they use a static image to show the circuit the home page. Formula E is racing event which usually takes place in a public road, so the circuit is made when there is a race coming.
Using image like this makes user couldn't really see where the racing takes place. The user is also not able to have interaction with the circuit which is quite not interactive.

* **Navigation:** After the user buy a ticket for the racing match, they can see all the necessary locations in the event but it is hard for them to find it if there is a good navigation there. The accuracy and annotation in the map is also important to help the user find places more effective and efficient.
